# HT: First Non-Repeating Character ( ** Interview Question)
# You have been given a string of lowercase letters.

# Write a function called first_non_repeating_char(string) that finds the first non-repeating character in the given string using a hash table (dictionary). If there is no non-repeating character in the string, the function should return None.

# For example, if the input string is "leetcode", the function should return "l" because "l" is the first character that appears only once in the string. Similarly, if the input string is "hello", the function should return "h" because "h" is the first non-repeating character in the string.

# The first_non_repeating_char function takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeating character in the string using a hash table (dictionary). Here's an explanation of how the function works:

# The function creates an empty hash table called char_counts to store the frequency of each character in the string.

# The first loop iterates through each character in the input string and uses the get method to access the current count of that character in the hash table. If the character is not already in the hash table, its count is initialized to 0. The count is then incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the character in the string.

# The second loop iterates through each character in the input string again. For each character, the function checks the count of that character in the hash table. If the count is equal to 1, then the character is not repeated in the string, so the function returns that character as the first non-repeating character.

# If no non-repeating character is found in the string, the function returns None.


# It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.



# Code with inline comments:



# def first_non_repeating_char(string):
#     # create an empty hash table to count the frequency of each character
#     char_counts = {}
#     # count the frequency of each character in the string
#     for char in string:
#         # this increments the count by 1 in the dictionary
#         char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1
#     # find the first non-repeating character in the string
#     for char in string:
#         if char_counts[char] == 1:
#             return char
#     # return None if no non-repeating character is found
#     return None
