Bubble Sort of LL ( ** Interview Question)
Assignment:

Your task is to implement the bubble_sort method within the LinkedList class. The bubble_sort method should sort the elements of the linked list in ascending order based on their values. The sorting should be done in-place, meaning you should not create a new linked list but rather modify the existing one.



Requirements:

The bubble_sort method should iterate through the linked list, comparing each pair of adjacent nodes and swapping their values if they are in the wrong order. This process should repeat until the entire list is sorted.

The method must handle linked lists of any length, including empty lists and lists with only one element. In cases where the list is empty or contains only one element, the method should simply return without making any changes.

You should not use any external libraries or built-in sorting functions to implement the sorting logic.

Optimize the bubble_sort method to stop early if the list becomes sorted before going through all the iterations.

Hints:

You can use a loop to iterate through the list multiple times, each time moving the largest unsorted value to its correct position in the sorted portion of the list.

To swap the values of two nodes, you can directly swap their value attributes without changing their position in the list.

Consider using a marker or a pointer to keep track of the portion of the list that is already sorted, to avoid unnecessary comparisons and swaps.



Input:

The LinkedList object containing a linked list with unsorted elements (self).



Output:

None. The method sorts the linked list in place.



Method Description:

If the length of the linked list is less than 2, the method returns and the list is assumed to be already sorted.

The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly iterating through the unsorted part of the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

The method starts with the entire linked list being the unsorted part of the list.

For each pass through the unsorted part of the list, the method iterates through each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

After each pass, the largest element in the unsorted part of the list will "bubble up" to the end of the list.

The method continues iterating through the unsorted part of the list until no swaps are made during a pass.

After the linked list is fully sorted, the head and tail pointers of the linked list are updated to reflect the new order of the nodes in the list.



Constraints:

The linked list can contain duplicates.

The method should be implemented in the LinkedList class.

The method should not use any additional data structures to sort the linked list.

This code is an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm tailored for a linked list.

Let's break it down in detail:



Function Definition:

def bubble_sort(self): This line defines a method named bubble_sort as part of a class (the class is not shown but implied by the use of self). This method will sort the elements of a linked list in ascending order.

Early Exit Check:

if self.length < 2: return: Before starting the sorting process, the code checks if the length of the list is less than 2 (meaning the list has 0 or 1 element). If this condition is true, the function returns immediately as a list with less than 2 elements is already sorted.

Initialization:

sorted_until = None: This line initializes a variable sorted_until to None. This variable will act as a marker to identify the part of the list that has already been sorted. Initially, nothing is sorted, so it's set to None.

Outer Loop - Tracking Sorted Section:

while sorted_until != self.head.next: This while loop forms the outer loop of the bubble sort. It continues to iterate as long as sorted_until is not equal to the second element of the list (self.head.next). When sorted_until reaches the second node, it means that the entire list is sorted.

Inner Loop - Bubble Sorting:

current = self.head: The current variable is set to the head of the list. It will be used to traverse the list from the start in each iteration of the outer loop.

while current.next != sorted_until: This while loop is where the actual sorting happens. It iterates over the list, stopping just before the sorted_until node. Initially, as sorted_until is None, this loop goes through the entire list.

Swapping Values:

next_node = current.next: Here, next_node is assigned the node right after current. It's used for comparing adjacent nodes.

if current.value > next_node.value: This if statement checks if the value of the current node is greater than the value of next_node. If true, it implies that these two nodes are in the wrong order and need to be swapped.

current.value, next_node.value = next_node.value, current.value: If the condition above is true, the values of current and next_node are swapped. This operation moves the larger value towards the end of the list.

Advancing the Current Node:

current = current.next: After possibly swapping the values with next_node, current is moved to the next node in the list. This step is crucial for progressing through the list.

Updating the Sorted Boundary:

sorted_until = current: After completing an iteration of the inner loop, sorted_until is updated to the last node checked by current. This marks a new boundary, indicating that all nodes after sorted_until are sorted. In the next iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will sort the remaining unsorted section.



In summary, this bubble sort implementation iterates through the linked list, repeatedly swapping adjacent nodes if they are in the wrong order, thus "bubbling" larger values towards the end of the list. The process continues until the entire list is sorted, which is indicated when the sorted_until marker reaches the second node in the list.



Note that this implementation modifies the linked list in place and does not return a new list.
